UISless
=======

Workaround for the awful service that is UIS


How it works
=======
1. User provides their UIS info
2. UISless logs them into UIS via HtmlUnit
3. Courses are pulled from UIS and categorized based on location and time
4. A Google map is populated with geographic and temporal information

  a. Users can go building by building to see what classes are being held there and when

  b. Users can search a class and see where and when it meets
5. If a PRN is provided by the user, registration may also be possible through UISless [planned]
